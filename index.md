# Welcome to the Adventure!
Adventure Generator is a choose your own adventure text based game where the narrator of the story is an articial intellegence. This project is heavily inspired by [AI Dungeons](https://play.aidungeon.io), another AI based choose your own adventure game created by Latitude. The goal of this project is to build off of the gameplay in AI Dungeons and add other features such as inventory, health, and narrative consistency.

## Checkout the Code
Instructions to install and run the code can found in the `README.md` in the main [github repo](https://github.com/nonas-hunter/adventure-generator).

- [*Attention is All You Need*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
This paper outlines the creation of the transformer architecture. It outlines the exact model used in this game!
- [*The Annotated Transformer*](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html)
This short paper shows an implementation of the transformer as shown in the original *Attention is All You Need*. The implementation is created by the amazing team working on OpenNMT: Open-Source Toolkit for Neural Machine Translation.
- [*Language Models are Few-Shot Learners*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)
This paper outlines the creation of GPT-3, the largest language model to date. GPT-3 is based on the transformer model suggest in *Attention is All You Need*. GPT-3 is also the model used in the original [AI Dungeons](https://play.aidungeon.io) game.
- [*BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers forLanguage Understanding*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)
BERT, a competitor of GPT-3, is another language model losely based on the transformer model suggested in *Attention is All You Need*. While BERT is not directly used in the game, I thought this was a really interesting read!
